·         In the “Suburban Metro Area” column, delete the word “City” in “Boise City.”

·         Add a hyphen between “Winston” and “Salem” in all references. (There are a few instances, where it says “Winston Salem,” instead of “Winston-Salem.”).

·         A 2016 ranking is given for Macon-Bibb County. Since this is the first time the city is on the list, the “2016 Ranking” should say “N/A.”

·         In the “Suburban Metro Area” column, change “Louisville/Jefferson County” to “Louisville-Jefferson County.”

·         A couple of St. Paul mentions do not include a period after St. Let’s correct that.
