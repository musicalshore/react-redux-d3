This page is comprised of the legacy content from previous years with a completely rebuilt map module integrated.  


The new map module is compiled using Webpack.  The legacy page content is the same as before with some minor tweaks/bug fixes. 




To create the dist that compiles the new map and combines it with the legacy page code:

`yarn install && npm run build`

This will create the stand alone page, map module and other assets in the 'dist' folder.



Other:

To run the local dev server for the map:

`yarn install && npm run start`
